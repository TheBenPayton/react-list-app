# react-list-app
One of my first React.js web apps. Lets users create a to-do list.
Missing the node modules folder. NEED REACT INSTALLED TO RUN!
Still in very early stages. Just a fun little side project to help me get used to the React.js framework with the use of its components and as welll as its multiple UI libraries etc!! :)
